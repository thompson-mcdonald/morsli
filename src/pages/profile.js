      <p>A 22-Year old video editor based in London, UK. Having just finished University, I’m experienced in making video content across the spectrum, from commercial social-media to experimental films. I’m currently working full-time creating branded content and social-media materials for Kyra TV, producing high-quality promotional videos and bringing new audience awareness to the YouTube platform. In my free time, I enjoy producing self-directed experimental videos alongside an avid interest in music and photography, leading to me shooting live events over the past few years -  including large festivals such as Sunfall (London), Dimensions &amp; Soundwave (Croatia). </p>
