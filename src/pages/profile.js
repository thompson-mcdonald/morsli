      <p>A 22-Year old video editor based in London, UK. Having finished university in 2018, Iâ€™m experienced in making video content across the spectrum, from commercial social-media to experimental films. Currently, I am working full-time creating branded content and social-media materials for Kyra TV, producing high-quality promotional videos with brands such as Nike, Red Bull, Nikon and Superdrug, alongside bringing new audience awareness to the YouTube platform. In my free time, I enjoy producing self-directed experimental videos as well as having an avid interest in music and photography, leading to me shooting live events over the past few years - including large festivals such as Sunfall (London), Dimensions & Soundwave (Croatia).</p>
