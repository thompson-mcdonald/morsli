      <p>I am a 21-Year old video editor based in London. UK. Having just finished University, I am experienced in making content across the spectrum, from commercial social videos to experimental films. I’m currently working full-time creating branded content and social-media materials for Kyra TV, producing high-quality promotional videos and bringing new audience awareness to the YouTube platform. In my free time, I enjoy producing self-directed experimental videos alongside an avid interest in music and photography, I’ve been shooting live events for the past few years -  including large festivals such as Sunfall (London) and Soundwave (Croatia). </p>
